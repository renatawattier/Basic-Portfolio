         I would like to start by saying I picked this photo for my profile because this is how I felt completing this homework. I just don't quite get what I am doing,
    and it was incredibly frustraing trying to complete this assigment. In case you are wondering, when I asked my husband to take this photo I asked him if it 
    looked like I was holding the Louvre. Obviously, he missed by a tinny bit and this how I am turning in this assigment.

        My Name is Renata Wattier and I was born and raised in Brazil. I moved to United States in 2000 to attend Union College in Lincoln, NE.  In 2005 I started
    working at State Farm in Lincoln, NE, and because of my job with State Farm I moved to Arizona in 2013. I am married to Jeff but you can call him Jeffy Pooh.
    I enjoy playing and watching sports, I used to play Roller Derby when I lived in Nebraska and had the opportunity to travel all over the country because of
    Roller Derby. If you have never attend a Roller Derby Bout and you enjoy watching full contact sports, you should give Roller Derby a try.

        Jeff and I enjoy traveling and we go to one big overseas trip every year, we just came back from Brazil the Saturday before the boot camp started and we are 
        planning a trip to Greece next year.  We are also planning a trip to Germany during Oktoberfest in a couple of years. I am not quite sure what is more difficult,
        trying to find things to write about myself or compleing the assigment. If you are curious to learn a little more about me just ask!
